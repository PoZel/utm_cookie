Save UTM parameters and initial referrer in a cookie


Description:
===========

This script saves UTM parameters in cookies whenever there are any UTM parameters in the URL. It also saves the initial referrer information in a cookie which is
never (365 days) overwritten.

Adding this script is useful for custom tracking. e.g. The values in the cookies
can be read and added to forms or stored in the backend database, etc.
